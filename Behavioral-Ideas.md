# Behavioral Ideas
This section will discuss potential ways a certain feature should act. It's important to record these ideas since no developer can remember everything about a project, and without this knowledge in the forefront of your mind can destroy the way the program behaves. 

## Pulling
We can use multiple approaches here: 

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Always use a pulling move to start a battle. | Use dia on every mob that we have as a target and is not fighting. |
| Only use a pulling move when a mob exceeds a certain distance. | Use dia only when a mob is beyond eight yalms. |
| Only use a pulling move when the recast timers are low. | Use absorb-str when we'll only have to wait three seconds for it to come off cooldown. |

Of course, we could always use any combination of strategies. One where we'll only pull when a mob exceeds a certain distance and we'll only have to wait a minimum of two seconds for the next pull attempt.
