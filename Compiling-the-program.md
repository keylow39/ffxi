### Compiling the Project Code
1. Go to "Build, Build Solution" in the menu bar.

    The program will begin to build, and you see “Build Success”in the status bar in the left corner of the screen. 

2. Find the Debug folder to get the compiled program.

    My new built executable was located at C:\Users\Mike\Desktop\EasyFarm-master\EasyFarm-master\EasyFarm\bin\Debug since I downloaded the code to my desktop.
