# EasyFarm
EasyFarm is a general purpose farming tool for Final Fantasy XI

The program's main goal is to reduce the work needed for farming, allowing players to concentrate on the important aspects of the game. Rather than relying on job specific optimizations, its general design allows for adapting to many situations and enables support all job types.
