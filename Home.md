* Yes and no. The program detects monsters in a aggressive state but cannot distinguish between aggressive and linking behaviors.

2. Clear the current route, and record a new waypoint. 
3. Start the program. 
You character will run and stop at the new waypoint. 

##### Why is the program not targeting mobs correctly or not at all?
* Try turning off the in-game auto target feature.
