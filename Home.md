# FAQ
**Does the program detect aggro?**

Yes, the program can detect whether the player has aggro.

**Why does the new version of the program crash?**

1. Using an old user preference file may cause the program to crash. Delete the preference file and let the program generate a new one.

Shut down the program, restart it and re-hit the start button.

Try turning off the in-game auto target feature and see if that fixes the problem.
