# Action Types 
There are two types of actions: Targeted and Buffing. 

## Targeted Actions
Targeted actions always require a target unit in order to be executed (usually the mob you are fighting). 

List    | Description | Typical List Action
------------|-------------|--------------------
Pulling     | These actions will be used until the mob becomes aggressive towards the player. | Dia
Battle      | These actions will only be used when the mob and player are fighting each other. | Fire
Weaponskill | These moves are used when the player has engaged the target. | Raging Axe

## Buffing Actions
Buffing actions on the other hand only require only the player to be casted. They are also not affected by distance settings. 

List     | Description | Typical List Action

Healing     | These actions are used    any time when the player is not healing (sitting down for hp or mp). | Cure
End         | These actions are triggered when no valid mob is nearby or the current target has died. | Protect
