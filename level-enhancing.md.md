# Leveling enhancing skill

1. Select the **End** tab.
2. Add three bar enhancing spells.
3. **Right-click** each spell.
4. Select **Player Options**
5. For each spell set Status to the correct status effect
  * Set barstone for barstone spell, barfire for barfire, etc..
6. Select the **Resting** tab.
7. Check the **MP** checkbox.
8. Set the **MP Down** slider to zero.

This will cause the player to cast each spell when the player
does not contain a bar spell's status effect. When a new bar spell's
status effect is applied, the old bar spell's effect will be overriden.
The program should continue this cycle until the player runs out of mp in which case they will rest.
